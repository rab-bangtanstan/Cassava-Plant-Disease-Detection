# Cassava-Plant-Disease-Detection
A smart plant disease diagnosis using deep neural networks. 

This project repository pertains to disease classification for cassava plants using deep learning approach.
The datasets used for this project is taken from two sources (Kaggle competitions)
The combined dataset consists of 7500 images in total where image augmentation was used to improve the minority class data samples.

CNN model used is DenseNet121 which was trained for 39 epochs giving a validation accuracy of 90%
